This weekend, we built **Lavoe**, the Cursor for music production, and won the largest prize at Hack the North: $10,000.

Our journey started the weekend before Hack the North, when we met up with no real agenda other than to bounce ideas around. As we shared bits about ourselves, one thing became clear very quickly: music was a significant part of all of our lives. Each of us had experimented with different DAWs in the past, and we all felt the same frustration: the learning curve for music production is steep, and powerful tools often feel inaccessible to beginners.

That sparked the core idea: what if a DAW had an AI side panel—agents that could actively assist producers as they worked? We believed that anyone should be able to create the music they hear in their head, without years of technical overhead. From there, we compared every DAW we had used or studied, discussing what each did well and what we wished it did better.

We left it there though, and went back to our own lives for that week before we reconvened for the big day.

I went to the venue the earliest I could for the swag and sponsors booth!! I talked to a lot of people, but the highlight was running into Jeff Nguyen, someone I’d been following on LinkedIn for a long time. Somehow, he recognized me, and then asked me to take a photo of him and Osher Ahn-Clifford on his phone. That interaction alone already made the weekend feel surreal.

The pre-event excitement didn’t stop there. Right before opening, Hack the North attempted to break the Guinness World Record for the most people simultaneously building interlocking plastic brick sculptures inside a single venue.

There were A LOT of people and they got people walking around and checking each finished piece so it was lowkey the most stressful Lego-like build I've ever done.

After opening, I didn't take another picture for the rest of the day - we were just so locked in. The only true breaks that we took were to get food. I remember this night we spent mostly just researching APIs and sketching the entire thing out.

I spent the early hour of this day coding and then walking back to my dorm. I actually got a good nights rest somehow.

The next day was a continuation of the first, and I spent much of my day refining the normal DAW features (recording, uploading files, and other types of inserts) and the timeline. There were also a bunch of errors I found with the catalog and the timeline, so I worked on debugging that too. I think we paced ourselves pretty well, because by the evening of Saturday, we were already thinking about our Devpost and pitching.

Side quests to collect Goose Games points! Ended up getting this giant Hack the North themed desk mat.

However it was about this time that we started to get really sick (we finished two packs of Halls in like 1 hour). In the end, I resorted to just drinking milk to calm it down because drinking water was kind of painful. 

This was the flow by the end of it (I made this after the hackathon).

So our newest problem now was that half the team's voice was so broken we unironically couldn't pitch and we were planning on like maybe doing a bit of singing to demo our project.

I woke up knowing my voice, and honestly my body, was not going to cooperate.

During the first round of judging, pitching felt like a battle for survival. I genuinely think our condition affected our delivery. There was also this extremely awkward moment when our judge went in to add a violin sound (it was definately a saxaphone), because we had used a different API that was faster to use up less time during the demo. 

Still, we pushed through. As the day went on, we had several sponsor-track pitches, and with practice (and adrenaline), we started to feel more confident. Given the circumstances, I’m incredibly proud of how we showed up.

- 1st Place – Rox: Best AI Agent
- 3rd Place – Windsurf: Best Project Built with Windsurf

Overall, it was an exhausting, chaotic, and unforgettable weekend and one I’ll be thinking about for a long time.
