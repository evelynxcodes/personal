This was the first solo trip I've ever taken, and I felt so adulty!!

Pre WiSE: I had to take a few days off of work to make it to the program. On my end, the process was just applying on the portal in June I think with basically just my resume, and then hearing back from them. There was a pre-program call at some point that just sorta went over logistics and stuff.

On my first day, I reconnected with friends (and made some new ones!) at the welcome dinner. The program hadn't started yet, and I was honestly just juggling a lot of travel issues with trying to explore as much of the city as possible. I've been to NYC before, but it's been a while, and was definately a different vibe with like 20 girls in a subway car.

Perhaps it was the adrenaline but I just couldn't sleep that night.

So yeah, I watched the sun rise and that brought me to the first day of WiSE.

We weren't allowed to take any pictures in the office or share anything basically, but TLDR of the 2 "workdays" was a lot of welcomes, some introductory knowledge to Jane Street as a company, and key ideas surrounding what they do. I also vividly remember a lot of probability games, and it was actually so enjoyable because everyone was equally competitive and calculating for no reason at all. I also really enjoyed being able to just see all the things I saw if that makes sense - it gave me a much better idea of what the company did and I feel like it gave me more information for me in choosing what I wanted out of my career in the future.

After our first day, we went on a bus that took us to see Wicked on Broadway. Literally if you had given all the shows in the world to choose from the show I would want to see in person most is Wicked, so I was VERY happy with this to say the least.

Ohoh and I got an autograph from one of the co-authors of The Art of Problem Solving.

There were definately a lot more highlights, but most of all I just really enjoyed the people that I was with and the fast-paced experience at a whole. I feel like I was teleported to another place and lived a two weeks worth of life in 4 days.

After the program was complete, I spent my last few hours exploring SoHo!
