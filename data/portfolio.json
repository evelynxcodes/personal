During its descent, our CanSat conducted experiments using Terrain Relative Navigation to precisely track its position and attitude, utilizing only an onboard camera and an inertial navigation system. This technology is essential in environments where GPS is unavailable, such as the Moon. The embedded software uses C/C++ and a finite state machine to manage the CanSat's operational states (Idle, Data Acquisition, Touchdown). Our innovative approach earned us the Best Technical and Best Scientific Mission awards at the competition. Following our success, we were invited to appear on the show \"Ask an Astronomer.\"","imageSrc":"/images/Screen Shot 2024-08-11 at 9.24.57 PM.png","url":"https://www.instagram.com/team__swordfish/","ctaText":"Visit Team Instagram ↗"},{"title":"Mortgage Payment Calculator","headline":"🏠 Internship at RBC - Summer 2024","description":"During my internship at RBC, my team led the development of a mortgage payment calculation web application designed to assist over 180,000 clients in selecting optimal mortgage payment options based on various inputs.
